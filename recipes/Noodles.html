    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. Fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. Perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package fettoccine noodles</li>
        <li>6 tablespoon butter, cut into piece</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring  to rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Stir in fettoccine noodles, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes</li>

        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
